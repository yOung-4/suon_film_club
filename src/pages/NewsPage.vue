            Wu Nianzhen, a principled businessman, resides in a Taipei apartment
            with his wife Minmin (Jin Yanling), children Tingting (Li Kailey)
            and Yangyang (Zhang Yangyang), and their grandmother. After his
            brother-in-law's chaotic wedding and the grandmother's sudden
            stroke, turmoil ensues. Minmin feels overwhelmed juggling work and
            home; Tingting struggles with guilt and relationship woes; and
            Nianzhen grapples with impending business failure and his steadfast
            pride. Amidst it all, only Yangyang remains seemingly untroubled,
            capturing life through his lens, but his few words hint at a deeper
            sorrow.
